	<!-- 1-We have done Parallel execution 2- Can give parameter, like URL,USERNAME,PASSWORD 
	3- cross browser Execution-- we can have one browser as firefox another as 
	Chrome and execute them parallely 4- if we Want to skip any method execution 
	in a Test case that is also possible with exclude tag 5- We can provide parallel 
	execution at method level as well 6- When we give thread-count=2, At Test 
	level what happens is that thread will take up a test case and starts executing 
	and once its free it will start the other one we can have the Thread count 
	on the basis of Test execution as well , which can help reducing the time 
	line of the Executiom -->
